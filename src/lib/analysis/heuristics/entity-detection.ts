 * Entity Address Detection
 *
 * Checks all input/output addresses against:
 * 1. OFAC sanctioned list (exact match, zero false positives)
 * 2. Known entity address filter (Bloom filter, 0.1% FPR)
 * 3. Behavioral patterns (exchange batch, mining pool)
 *
 * Entity matches help users understand who they are transacting with
 * and inform downstream analysis (e.g., post-mix to exchange detection).
 *
 * Severity:
 *   - OFAC match: critical (-20)
 *   - Known entity in inputs: medium (-3)
 *   - Known entity in outputs: low (informational, -1)
 *   - Behavioral: low (informational, 0)
