/**
 * Ricochet Hop 0 Detection
 *
 * Detects the first hop of a Ricochet transaction by identifying the
 * known Ashigaru fee address and expected fee amount. Ricochet adds
 * 4 extra hops between a CoinJoin and the final destination, creating
 * transactional distance that defeats shallow chain analysis.
 *
 * Pattern:
 * - 3+ outputs (fee + ricochet amount + change)
 * - One output pays exactly 100,000 sats to the Ashigaru fee address
 *
 * The PayNym variant of Ricochet is undetectable by design. If this
 * detection fires, the non-PayNym (standard) variant was used.
 *
 * Impact: +5 (good privacy practice)
